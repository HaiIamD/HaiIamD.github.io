    "quote": "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, 'I lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.' You must do the thing you think you cannot do. Remember, no one can make you feel inferior without your consent."

    "quote": "Twenty years from now, you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So, throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. Don't let schooling interfere with your education."

    "quote": "The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched—they must be felt with the heart. Keep your face always toward the sunshine—and shadows will fall behind you. The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision."

    "quote": "The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. All our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them. It's kind of fun to do the impossible. The more you like yourself, the less you are like anyone else, which makes you unique."

    "quote": "In the depth of winter, I finally learned that there was in me an invincible summer. Autumn is a second spring when every leaf is a flower. Don't walk behind me; I may not lead. Don't walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend."

    "quote": "It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live. Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light. Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic."

    "name": "Ralph Waldo Emerson",
    "quote": "Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals. To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."

    "name": "Vincent van Gogh",
    "quote": "I would rather die of passion than of boredom. If you hear a voice within you say 'you cannot paint,' then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced. Great things are not done by impulse but by a series of small things brought together. Normality is a paved road: It’s comfortable to walk, but no flowers grow on it."

    "name": "C.S. Lewis",
    "quote": "You can make anything by writing. You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream. You can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me. You can't go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending."

    "name": "Harriet Beecher Stowe",
    "quote": "The bitterest tears shed over graves are for words left unsaid and deeds left undone. Women are the real architects of society. It's a matter of taking the side of the weak against the strong, something the best people have always done."
